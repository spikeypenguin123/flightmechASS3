NOTE: For our visualiser, a 3rd-party Robotics Toolbox is required. For this reason, the visualiser is currently set to OFF (`main.m line 21`). The toolbox is installable by double-clicking `RTB.mltbx` in the MATLAB file explorer if the visualiser is desired. Videos are provided for each maneuver as well (impulse maneuvers at CG1, 180kts).

To run, execute `main.m` in MATLAB.

To change flight plan, change `CONFIG.flight_plan` in `main.m line 20`.
